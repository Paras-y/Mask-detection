# Mask-detection
2020 has been a year marked by the COVID-19
pandemic. This event has caused disruptions to many aspects of normal life. An important aspect in reducing the impact of
the pandemic is to control its spread.

In this post, I will talk about a custom object detector that I trained using Darknet, which detects if you have worn a mask or not. Darknet is an open-source neural network framework written in C and CUDA and supports CPU and GPU computation. Using Darknet, I trained a YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detector.
Very briefly speaking, YOLO detects all the objects in an image in one go. This post will not discuss the details of YOLO. Particulars of YOLO can be found in the papers here and here.
